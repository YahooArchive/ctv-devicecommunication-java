<p>
Yahoo! Connected TV’s device communication model enables new and exciting TV-viewing experiences driven by the sophisticated controls available on today’s tablets, laptops, and mobile phones. A new generation of TV Widget capabilities is now available to consumers, including gesture-based, multi-display, and multi-user features for intensive gaming, multimedia, and social applications.<br />
This device communication platform supports two-way message-passing between Internet-enabled devices and Connected TVs running the Yahoo! Widget Engine. Keyboard, navigation, and widget-specific messages can be communicated through a new protocol over a local network.
